## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am Ujjawal, born in 2004, armed with a BCA, and currently on a mission to become an expert Java developer. My daily workflow lives in the terminal within an Arch Linux + Hyprland environment. I build database engines, CLI tools in Java, and deeply study Systems Architecture, Spring Boot, and Core Java from First Principles.
